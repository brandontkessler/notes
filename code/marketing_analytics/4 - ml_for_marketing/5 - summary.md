# summary

## Key Metrics

* Accuracy - % of correctly predicted labels (both churn and non-churn)
* Precision - % of total model's positive class predictions (predicted as churned and did actually churn)
* Recall - % of total positive class samples (number of total churn that was correctly classified as such)

## Model Tuning

* Logistic Regression - Tune based on L1 regularization
* Decision Tree - Prone to overfitting. Tune based on depth parameter
